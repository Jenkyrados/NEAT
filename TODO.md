Priority :
- Get species done to have a working set

Important :
- Fix pointer / not pointer choices (garbage right now)
- Fix ConstContainer usage?

Future ideas :
- Add non-sigmoid transformation neurons
- Add non-boolean output possibility (float64)
- Add other possibilities for weight mutation
- Make bias optional
- Implement a way to get maxNodes from maxWeights (most commonly used method)
- Implement initial weight for connections
- Implement initial mutation chance change weights
